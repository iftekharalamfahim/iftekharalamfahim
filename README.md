👋 Hello World! This is Iftekhar Fahim. I'm a Junior Software Engineering student at **Sichuan University**. My focus is on building robust, full-stack web applications by using strong foundations in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

### 💻 My Core Stack & Expertise

I prefer the Next.js ecosystem for web projects, but my background covers several key areas.

| Category | Technologies |
| --- | --- |
| **Languages** | C++, Python, JavaScript (JS), Java, C |
| **Web** | **Next.js (Preferred, with TypeScript)**, React, Node.js, Express.js  |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB |
| **Foundations** | DSA, Git, OpenGL, System Level Programming |
| **Tools & Design** | GSAP (Animation), Figma |

### 🚀 Projects I'm Actively Building

These projects demonstrate my ability to handle end-to-end development, from setup to deployment.

* **ghilu (Forum App):** A knowledge-sharing platform (like a simple Stack Overflow). Built with Next.js and TypeScript. I managed the user sign-in process using **Auth.js** to handle Google, GitHub, and email authentication.
* **PsiLoop (Web Service Site):** The marketing site for my web service company. It's a clean, single-page application using **Next.js, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS**. I included backend security logic, such as using the **Node Crypto module** for OTP generation.

### 💡 Approach & Philosophy

My approach to building and collaborating is structured and focused on execution.

* **Problem-Solving:** I break down complex problems into smaller, logical steps, solving and testing each piece individually.
* **Teamwork:** I prioritize clear task identification, assigning roles based on skill, and disciplined time management to ensure project timelines are met.

### 🌱 Current Goals & Future Focus

* **C++:** Completing my C++ curriculum, including advanced concepts needed for competitive coding. I am eager to participate in hackathons.
* **Community:** I am organizing a **GitHub club** for international students in my class to encourage project collaboration and idea sharing.
* **Career:** My primary goal is securing a **Summer 2026 Software Engineering Internship** at an impactful technology company.
